description: Sometimes you're working hard and a trip to Haney Shoes just doesn't work out. Our Red Wing Shoemobile program provides mobile truck visits to workplaces around the region with individual measured fitting and a 15% discount on all safety styles. Our mobile truck is stocked with the Midwest's largest selection of safety footwear including composite toe, metatarsal guard, puncture-resistant, and fire-resistant styles from brands like Red Wing, Irish Setter, Worx, Keen, Timberland, Carolina, Wolverine, Dr. Marten's, Nautilus, Reebok, and New Balance. We also bring Carhartt workwear, socks, care accessories, and more. And if we don't have what you're looking for, we'll order and deliver. Some might say we're stuck in the past, but we've never been stuck in one place. For Shoemobile inquiries, please contact Shane Rupe directly at 402-619-2415.
