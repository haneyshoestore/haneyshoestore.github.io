description: There's more to buying a pair of shoes than simply buying a pair of shoes. We carry everything you need to ensure that your investment stays looking and feeling like new. Your shoes will eventually begin to lose some of their original structure, which is why we offer insoles providing several levels of support from brands like Spenco, Sole, and New Balance. When they begin to lose their luster, we'll help you find the perfect leather cream or conditioner and other care products, including brushes, protective sprays, cleaners, toe guards, laces, and rubber overshoes. And our extensive line of American-made Wigwam socks will help keep your feet, and your shoes, comfortable and dry. We're dedicated to helping you take care of your shoes, so that they keep taking care of you.
